# Carbon_Emission_Prediction-Week2-
This notebook aims to analyze country-specific data to understand and predict carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions per capita using various socioeconomic and energy-related features.

📌 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following key variables:

Country: Name of the country.

Year: The year of observation.

CO₂ per capita: Target variable to predict.

Other features: Includes cereal yield, foreign direct investment (% of GDP), gross national income per capita, energy use per GDP, total energy use, and total CO₂ emissions.

🔍 Data Exploration Process
The exploration follows several key steps:

Missing Value Analysis
Checks for missing or null entries in the dataset.

Univariate Analysis
Uses boxplots, histograms, and descriptive statistics to explore the distribution of each feature.

Bivariate Analysis
Examines relationships between the target variable (CO₂ per capita) and other features using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

Outlier Detection
Identifies extreme values that may skew analysis using boxplots and statistical thresholds.

📊 Visualizations Used
Boxplots: For spotting outliers and distribution asymmetry.

Heatmaps: To understand feature correlations.

Scatter Plots: To visualize pairwise relationships between variables.

💡 Goal
The end goal is to use this cleaned and explored data to build machine learning models that can accurately predict CO₂ emissions based on various inputs, aiding in policy and environmental decision-making.
